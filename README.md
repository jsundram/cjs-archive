- [x] github repository
- [x] copy stitchwithgoogle code from https://stitch.withgoogle.com/projects/7798201880332395140?pli=1
- [x] autogenerate pages with tables for sheets 3 and 4.
- [ ] deploy to github pages and send dad a link
- [ ] figure out how to templatize this nicely instead of cut-and-paste monstrosity

## Description
idea is that excel spreadsheets have the content, pull the data into csvs, use python to generate html.
use about.html as the template file for the repository.
