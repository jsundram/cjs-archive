Clarence J. Sundram, JD, is a nationally recognized expert on conditions in institutions and community programs for persons with mental disabilities. Currently, he serves as the Independent Monitor for the federal court overseeing the implementation of a Settlement Agreement class action which offers approximately 4000 persons with mental illness residing in adult homes in NYC the opportunity to move to supported housing with support services. Mr. Sundram's reports to the Court have influenced numerous refinements in the implementation process including the creation of a peer bridger program to be implemented in 22 impacted adult homes.

In March 2011, Governor Andrew Cuomo asked Mr. Sundram to serve as Special Advisor to the Governor for Vulnerable Persons to help address the issue of abuse and neglect of persons in residential care. The report he made to the Governor in April 2012 "The Measure Of A Society: Protection Of Vulnerable  Persons In Residential Facilities Against Abuse & Neglect" recommended sweeping reforms in the system for prevention, reporting, investigating and responding to such incidents in New York. Governor Cuomo proposed and the legislature unanimously adopted The Protection of People with Special Needs Act, implementing the key recommendations of the report, on June 20, 2012.
