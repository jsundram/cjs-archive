                This report describes the continuing decline in the number of class members transitioning each year since 2017, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The extraordinary conditions led the parties and the court to agree to suspend the Transition Metric Reports until February 2022.  This report also discusses the closure of the Brooklyn Terrace Home for Adults and the transfer of its residents to supported housing and other congregate care facilities.  It also discusses an investigation by the Independent Reviewer into complaints of Discouragement and Interference which culminated in a Settlement Agreement with the Wavecrest Home for Adults on March 17, 2021.
