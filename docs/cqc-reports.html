Allegations of inadequate supervision and inappropriate medication practices in the home prompted the Commission to initiate a separate review of the home itself. These allegations were brought to the Commission's attention by Binghamton Psychiatric Center's Board of Visitors, which raised concerns over the supervision and medication practices in the home.

            Medicaid-eligible individuals released from State psychiatric and developmental centers have experienced lengthy delays in the receipt of Medicaid cards, which adversely affect their access to needed services in the community and, at the same time, inappropriately reduce federal financial participation in the cost of these services. This Commission study is of the Medicaid card issuance process to determine the causes and effects of such delays. The report reflects conditions found to exist from 1976 through early 1979 -- the period in which the sample population experienced delays in the receipt of Medicaid cards.

            The report recommends that the developmental center take steps to ensure coordination and communication among medical staff charged with care of clients who are seriously ill. Specifically, the report recommends: that clients deemed ill enough to be sent to an emergency room should be promptly evaluated by a facility physician upon return; and,  that facility nurses document decisions to deviate from established client treatment regimens. In addition, the report recommends that a transfer form be developed to include information, regarding the special needs of handicapped clients, for use whenever such clients are sent to other facilities or to outside practitioners, to increase communication between facility and community physicians. The report further recommends that the developmental center administration proceed, through education and direct intervention, to ensure that local general hospital physicians provide the same emergency care to developmental center clients as is afforded to the general public, and not misconstrue the developmental center's medical unit as comparable to a hospital's acute care surgical unit. Finally, the Commission report recommends that, following the unanticipated death of a client, there should be a forum for staff of all levels to exchange information, identify problem areas and plan for future intervention to prevent the recurrence of such deaths

             In the process of staff restraining this patient and placing him in a tray chair, the patient apparently suffered fractures of the ribs and sternum. The report determined that the facility staff lacked a team approach and consistency in their interactions with the patients, and improper methods were used in restraining this violent patient with the tray chair, an unauthorized restraint, in violation of the Mental Hygiene Law. No responsibility was clearly assigned to one treating physician as the focal point for all patient-related communications and continuity of care responsibility for this patient who was undergoing an acute medical episode.

For nine months during 1979, the Commission conducted a comprehensive review of BPC's family care program in response to both expressions of community concern at Commission hearings and the Office of Mental Health request for independent scrutiny of the program following published reports of various problems affecting the quality of care.

            The Commission and its Mental Hygiene Medical Review Board investigation into this case found that, while there may have been a necessity to place this patient in a camisole for prolonged periods during his stay on the intensive care unit, there was no documentation by a physician justifying its use. More disturbing was the evident failure of the psychiatric resident to examine the patient prior to authorizing the use of a camisole. This physician had attended to the patient earlier in the day when he was found to be perspiring, hyperventilating and agitated. He knew, or should have known, of the temperature control problems being experienced by the unit. In this case the medical rationale for medication doses exceeding Department of Mental Hygiene Drug Manual guidelines also was not subject to appropriate consultation, consent and documentation; medication orders were not clearly written and conditions for administration were not coordinated with nursing staff.

            The Commission concluded the death could have been avoided. Responsibility was shared by the direct care staff on duty the day she died. Staff's failure to monitor her closely, even after her third disappearance within a relatively brief period of time, was one factor responsible for Miss Alenza being able to leave the unit undetected and for her eventual fall from the fifth floor terrace to her death.

            In their review, the Mental Hygiene Medical Review Board stated this unfortunate case was representative of "a series of errors back and forth...a problem of communication." The physicians on the Board noted that this case also raises questions about patients who decompensate frequently and postulated that, "treating them from a base in a hospital rather than returning them to the community" might prove to be more beneficial. This case depicts clinical chaos which culminated in a patient's falling through the cracks despite an overabundance of therapists and a variety of services.

            Richard Sanders was a likable resident with a cadre of friends on the staff; his nemesis was a unilateral surgical decision and the swift processing of this decision which found him in surgery before interventions could be initiated. The changing of the preoperative diagnosis by the surgeon less than 24 hours before surgery, without notification to NDC officials, and the surgeon's previous intent to include permission for possible orchiectomy without rationale lends credence to the Commission and Mental Hygiene Medical Review Board's belief that the surgeon's actions in this case were questionable. Further, the intervention and deficient workup by the medical specialist and anesthetist exemplify the poor medical care delivered to this patient. There appeared to be a casual attitude towards unnecessary surgery among some medical practitioners at the facility.

But, in attempting to cope with the patient's agitated behavior, on numerous occasions both the State Mental Hygiene Laws and the Office of Mental Health regulations governing the use of restraints and seclusion were disregarded.

             The Commission report illustrates the consequences of permitting untrained and unqualified persons to operate and staff a residential program for the developmentally disabled. Investigation findings disclosed that 9 developmentally disabled residents were left in the sole custody of an untrained 18-year-old relief staff person who was working a 16-hour shift and whose only previous work experience had been with the physically handicapped. All other staff of this residence had received little or no training after being hired. This was compounded by a lack of supervision of such staff and the lack of a formal supervisory on-call system for emergencies.

            This is a report on the Commission's review of conditions at Manhattan Psychiatric Center (MPC). This review began as an outgrowth of the Commission's Mental Hygiene Medical Review Board reviews of patient deaths at MPC in 1979, which raised questions regarding management and treatment practices at the facility. In April of 1980 our findings were shared with the Office of Mental Health and MPC and a plan of correction was developed. During 1981, Commission staff conducted a follow-up on the implementation through a second in-depth review at Manhattan Psychiatric Center.

The Board observed that it is not accepted medical practice that permission be sought from attending physicians in order to utilize a hospital's emergency service, and he abrogated his responsibility as an advocate for the mentally disabled by knowingly allowing a lesser level of care to be afforded this client than he would have tolerated with private patients.

            Tremendous variations in the environmental quality, caliber of services provided and in specific areas of management at 10 private residential facilities serving significantly-varying mentally retarded populations point to basic internal weaknesses in the regulatory process, according to this Commission report. The Commission's report on a review of 10 of New York State's 18 "private schools" for the mentally retarded, cites some programs as exceptional while highlighting others with significant deficiencies, in the areas of environment, medication administration practices and the assessment and programming of clients. All private schools are certified and regulated by the State's Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities (OMRDD).

            The Commission's investigation determined Mr. Paz was a difficult patient; but the Board noted such patients are not unique and manipulation, noncompliance, and lack of insight and judgment regarding their condition are not uncommon features of chronic "revolving door" patients. An increasing number of mentally persons, particularly younger patients, are also alcohol and drug abusers. It is clear that a better effort needs to be made to confront the admittedly difficult challenge such patients present to State psychiatric facilities.

            In this case, a 70-year-old patient died in October 1983 of complications six months following surgery to correct a hip fracture. The report chronicles a six-month period of unexplained delays, inadequate pre- and post-operative medical care, and poor follow-up medical and nursing care at both Central Islip and Pilgrim Psychiatric Centers, during which the patient developed many severe and infected bedsores, and suffered a serious weight loss which was untreated. Fragmented care, with no single physician having responsibility for medically monitoring and coordinating the care of the patient, was found to have resulted in both the inattention to her medical needs which led to her progressive deterioration, and in the delay in transferring her back to Central Islip Psychiatric Center until it was too late to save her life.

            This Commission policy paper reports that a high percentage of severely mentally ill individuals in New York State also abuse alcohol and/or drugs, but do not receive treatment for these additional problems. The critical lack of inpatient and community-based services for mentally ill persons with these multiple disabilities creates an enormous and costly gap, which results in increased psychiatric hospitalization rates and longer lengths of stay for such patients, substantially contributing to overcrowding of psychiatric admission units involuntary, municipal and State hospitals.

            This report demonstrates how unfocused service planning, poor interagency coordination, and a lack of follow-up can subvert the mission of agencies responsible for protecting vulnerable adults. A mentally retarded beneficiary of a $200,000 trust fund under a conservatorship was kept locked in a small, filthy, barren room in a frail, elderly woman's home for the last years of his life. He died as a result of neglect and deprivation because local social services and mental retardation offices, as well as court-appointed conservators and a community-based physician, all failed in their duties, leaving him to spend his last days sitting on a commode, with little or no stimulation, while his few social skills deteriorated from disuse.

The Commission report identified numerous weaknesses in accountability for mental health outpatient program performance and their cost-effective expenditure of public funds.

The report, regarding the Hawthorne Cedar Knolls (HCK) facility in Westchester County also questioned the effectiveness of existing models of care and treatment for seriously mentally ill children, who require a greater degree of structure and intensive treatment than such programs are designed to provide.

During the emergency room assessment, Goldstein reported feeling suicidal and hearing voices telling him to kill people. Psychiatric social workers and an emergency room physician who interviewed Goldstein discussed their observations by telephone with the on call psychiatrist. The report calls for new policies for hospital emergency rooms requiring that an experienced psychiatrist conduct a personal examination of patients likely to cause serious harm to themselves or others. The lack of such personal evaluations by experienced psychiatrists was a common factor in tragic incidents cited by the Commission.

            This report of a three-year study called for greater efforts to be made to ensure the protection of children in residential mental hygiene facilities who surface as "repeat" alleged victims in child abuse and neglect reports to the State Central Register. At the same time, the Commission noted that, contrary to the common images of battered children, sadistic abuse or gross neglect of basic needs that the terms "child abuse and neglect" conjure up, in over two-thirds of the reports filed there was no reported physical injury to the child, and in another 25 percent of the cases the injury was treated with first aid. Six percent of the cases involved more serious injury and two cases involved cases involved the death of a child.

            The Commission found that the majority of parents/guardians neither are adequately informed, nor is their permission sought before their children are administered psychiatric drugs in state-operated children's psychiatric facilities. To protect patient rights and involve families in treatment planning, the Commission report strongly recommends to the State Office of Mental Health (OMH) that parents and guardians be given comprehensive information about psychoactive medication, and their written informed consent be obtained by psychiatric facilities before such medication is given to minor children.

A survey of 275 courts in 40 counties throughout the state by the Commission in conjunction with the State Bar Association Committee on Mental and Physical Disabilities found limited accessibility for persons with visual and hearing impairments, and few accommodations for persons with mental disabilities. The survey report makes recommendations for the court system to fully comply with the requirements of the ADA, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in access to the services, programs and activities of state and local governments.

As a result of diversion of over one-half million dollars of the revenues during a five-year period by CLA's executive director and his wife who served as president of a phantom board of directors, residents of the only group home it operated lived in poor conditions without active treatment and recreation, and the home was chronically out-of-compliance with OMRDD regulations.

            This report is on the State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities' (OMRDD) system for processing appeals of Medicaid rates for community-based programs, which does not adequately safeguard the expenditure of public funds or control costs. The system, which is intended to ensure that Medicaid rates are sufficient to cover the costs of efficiently-run facilities, granted appeal funding of $22 million in 1991, even though in many cases the money was not spent on the purpose for which it was claimed, or not spent at all. The Commission found that OMRDD failed to prevent the funding of excessive agency administrative costs, restrict spending to the purposes of the appeals, or recoup appeal monies that were not spent

It concludes with recommendations to the Legislature and OMH to both streamline and improve the administration of restraint and seclusion in psychiatric facilities.

            While conducting a review of freestanding mental health clinics, Commission fiscal staff visited clinics throughout the state to look behind reported cost and productivity figures to gain an understanding of high and low-cost clinic operating practices. With the hope of replicating sound operating practices statewide, the Commission visited QCNI because it appeared to be one of the more efficient clinics licensed by OMH, with 1992 costs per 30-minute individual psychotherapy session at less than one-half of the statewide average, and clinician visits per day almost three times the statewide clinic average. But the Commission's review determined that this seeming efficiency concealed a clinic program rife with serious problems in the quality of its high-volume services, improper billings to Medicaid accounting for almost one-fifth of its Medicaid income, diversion of agency assets to senior executives, failure of the board of directors to exercise its fiduciary responsibilities, and unprofessional conduct by the agency's CPA who helped conceal financial irregularities from the board of directors and OMH.

            This Commission review of incident management practices at five state psychiatric centers surfaced several decidedly positive findings: episodes of patient elopements were reduced by more than 80% from 1994 to 1996. When incidents jeopardizing patient safety are identified, patients are provided prompt protective measures and/or treatment services; and incident investigations usually were timely and thorough, though some facilities need to improve in these areas and in the use and composition of Incident Review Committees (IRCs).
