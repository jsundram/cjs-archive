Specifically, the report recommends: that clients deemed ill enough to be sent to an emergency room should be promptly evaluated by a facility physician upon return; and,  that facility nurses document decisions to deviate from established client treatment regimens. In addition, the report recommends that a transfer form be developed to include information, regarding the special needs of handicapped clients, for use whenever such clients are sent to other facilities or to outside practitioners, to increase communication between facility and community physicians. The report further recommends that the developmental center administration proceed, through education and direct intervention, to ensure that local general hospital physicians provide the same emergency care to developmental center clients as is afforded to the general public, and not misconstrue the developmental center's medical unit as comparable to a hospital's acute care surgical unit. Finally, the Commission report recommends that, following the unanticipated death of a client, there should be a forum for staff of all levels to exchange information, identify problem areas and plan for future intervention to prevent the recurrence of such deaths                                                       ",

More disturbing was the evident failure of the psychiatric resident to examine the patient prior to authorizing the use of a camisole. This physician had attended to the patient earlier in the day when he was found to be perspiring, hyperventilating and agitated. He knew, or should have known, of the temperature control problems being experienced by the unit. In this case the medical rationale for medication doses exceeding Department of Mental Hygiene Drug Manual guidelines also was not subject to appropriate consultation, consent and documentation; medication orders were not clearly written and conditions for administration were not coordinated with nursing staff.",

The changing of the preoperative diagnosis by the surgeon less than 24 hours before surgery, without notification to NDC officials, and the surgeon's previous intent to include permission for possible orchiectomy without rationale lends credence to the Commission and Mental Hygiene Medical Review Board's belief that the surgeon's actions in this case were questionable. Further, the intervention and deficient workup by the medical specialist and anesthetist exemplify the poor medical care delivered to this patient.

The Board observed that it is not accepted medical practice that permission be sought from attending physicians in order to utilize a hospital's emergency service, and he abrogated his responsibility as an advocate for the mentally disabled by knowingly allowing a lesser level of care to be afforded this client than he would have tolerated with private patients.",

The Commission found that OMRDD failed to prevent the funding of excessive agency administrative costs, restrict spending to the purposes of the appeals, or recoup appeal monies that were not spent",

But the Commission's review determined that this seeming efficiency concealed a clinic program rife with serious problems in the quality of its high-volume services, improper billings to Medicaid accounting for almost one-fifth of its Medicaid income, diversion of agency assets to senior executives, failure of the board of directors to exercise its fiduciary responsibilities, and unprofessional conduct by the agency's CPA who helped conceal financial irregularities from the board of directors and OMH.",

    "description": "Nearly 40 years before reporting in 2011 by the New York Times prompted a re-examination of the care for people with special needs, the state underwent a similar phase of introspection and reform. On the first installment of the “Justice for All” series, we highlight this four decades of history, including New York’s response to the failings at the Willowbrook school, the creation of an advocate, and a report intended to transform care for the most vulnerable New Yorkers.",

    "description": "A 2012 report examining the state’s care for people with special needs offered a holistic series of recommendations on how to improve the quality of supervision and supports for vulnerable New Yorkers, but the reaction from state policymakers at the time – and since – has largely ignored the broader conversation about the human services system. On the third installment of the “Justice for All” series, we focus primarily on the workforce providing care to more than 1 million New Yorkers with special needs. We also examine the independence of the Justice Center for the Protection of People with Special Needs and consider how abuse and neglect is reported.",
