The report determined that the facility staff lacked a team approach and consistency in their interactions with the patients, and improper methods were used in restraining this violent patient with the tray chair, an unauthorized restraint, in violation of the Mental Hygiene Law. No responsibility was clearly assigned to one treating physician as the focal point for all patient-related communications and continuity of care responsibility for this patient who was undergoing an acute medical episode.",

Aug-96,Quality of Care,A Brief Report on Active Programming in State Psychiatric Centers: Has Anything Changed? ,"While conducting a previous review and follow-up on living conditions at all state psychiatric centers, the Commission had found that although conditions varied among facilities, a common factor eroding the quality of life for patients was idleness. Without meaningful activities, most patients spent their days either sitting in overcrowded dayrooms, wandering, sleeping or staring at television, with few opportunities to develop or retain skills necessary for maintaining a sense of worth and good mental health. Partly in response to the Commission's published recommendations for constructive patient programming or daily activity, the Legislature in 1988 passed legislation requiring the Office of Mental Health (OMH) to establish standards for active programming, including consideration of the social, vocational, educational and recreational needs of each patient, and a minimum number of hours of activities to be provided each patient weekly unless exempted for medical or clinical reasons.",

The Commission's report on a review of 10 of New York State's 18 ""private schools"" for the mentally retarded, cites some programs as exceptional while highlighting others with significant deficiencies, in the areas of environment, medication administration practices and the assessment and programming of clients.

Aug-94,Quality of Care,Care and Treatment for Persons with Multiple Disabilities: A Progress Report,"Care and treatment for individuals with both a developmental disability, such as mental retardation and a psychiatric diagnosis, have improved significantly over the years as many dually-diagnosed individuals have moved to special units called multiply-disabled units (MDUs), where they are better able to learn to control undesirable behavior and develop new skills. The Commission's study of eight MDUs, in both state psychiatric centers operated by the State Office of Mental Health (OMH) and developmental centers operated by the State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities (OMRDD), indicates that since 1978 over 2,000 psychiatric center patients have been transferred to MDUs at developmental centers, which the Commission found better equipped to meet their needs and prepare them to live outside institutions.

Six percent of the cases involved more serious injury and two cases involved cases involved the death of a child.",

Aug-88,Policy,Discharge Practices of Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities,"This Commission report concludes that, although inpatient psychiatric facilities devote considerable resources to discharge planning for patients, these efforts are often in vain because critical steps and follow up are not assured. As a result, discharged patients often do not receive the services they need and many lose contact with the mental health system. The Commission studied 60 patients discharged from five New York City metropolitan area inpatient psychiatric facilities who were followed for a six-month period.",

Jun-89,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Francis Helms,"This report demonstrates how unfocused service planning, poor interagency coordination, and a lack of follow-up can subvert the mission of agencies responsible for protecting vulnerable adults. A mentally retarded beneficiary of a $200,000 trust fund under a conservatorship was kept locked in a small, filthy, barren room in a frail, elderly woman's home for the last years of his life. He died as a result of neglect and deprivation because local social services and mental retardation offices, as well as court-appointed conservators and a community-based physician, all failed in their duties, leaving him to spend his last days sitting on a commode, with little or no stimulation, while his few social skills deteriorated from disuse.",
Sep-95,Policy,"Governance of Restraint and Seclusion Practices by NYS Law, Regulation, and Policy","The Commission's study of the use of restraint and seclusion in New York State psychiatric facilities, requested by the Legislature, outlines the confusion and gaps resulting from the four sets of inconsistent, contradictory, and duplicative directives on restraint and seclusion contained in state law, state regulations, the policies of the State Office of Mental Health (OMH), and in standards issued by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO).

The report chronicles a six-month period of unexplained delays, inadequate pre- and post-operative medical care, and poor follow-up medical and nursing care at both Central Islip and Pilgrim Psychiatric Centers, during which the patient developed many severe and infected bedsores, and suffered a serious weight loss which was untreated.

Nov-80,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Aaron Maxwell - A Resident of Rome Developmental Center,"This is a report of a resident of Rome Developmental Center (RDC) who died following surgery. The report recommends that RDC take steps to ensure coordination among treating physicians of various specialties whenever elective surgery upon a resident is contemplated, and that all standard diagnostic procedures be utilized in deciding upon the course of treatment for mentally retarded patients. The report also recommends: that facility physicians, including the treating psychiatrist, meet with the consulting surgeon in cases involving elective surgery and reach agreement on the need for surgery; that second opinions be obtained in cases of elective surgery; that assessments by outside consultants be based upon more than a single patient visit; and, that following the recommendation of an outside consultant, surgery be done in a timely manner, with the need for surgery to be reassessed in cases of significant time lapse.",

The cause of death was determined to be myocarditis, acute heart failure.",
Jul-80,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Alice S. - A Resident of Craig Developmental Center,"The report recommends that the developmental center negotiate with the local general hospital, upon which it relies for medical care, to ensure provision of proper post- operative care for the developmental center clients. The developmental center was also urged to clarify of its medical unit as an infirmary providing skilled nursing care, rather than an acute medical care hospital.

Mar-81,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Alphonse Rio - A Patient at South Beach Psychiatric Center,"The Commission and its Mental Hygiene Medical Review Board investigation into this case found that, while there may have been a necessity to place this patient in a camisole for prolonged periods during his stay on the intensive care unit, there was no documentation by a physician justifying its use. More disturbing was the evident failure of the psychiatric resident to examine the patient prior to authorizing the use of a camisole. This physician had attended to the patient earlier in the day when he was found to be perspiring, hyperventilating and agitated. He knew, or should have known, of the temperature control problems being experienced by the unit. In this case the medical rationale for medication doses exceeding Department of Mental Hygiene Drug Manual guidelines also was not subject to appropriate consultation, consent and documentation; medication orders were not clearly written and conditions for administration were not coordinated with nursing staff.",

Sep-81,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Eileen Alenza - A Resident of Bronx Developmental Center,"The Commission concluded the death could have been avoided. Responsibility was shared by the direct care staff on duty the day she died.

Mar-82,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Faye Trina - A Resident of Brooklyn Community Residence Operated by Brooklyn School for Special Children, The Commission report illustrates the consequences of permitting untrained and unqualified persons to operate and staff a residential program for the developmentally disabled. Investigation findings disclosed that 9 developmentally disabled residents were left in the sole custody of an untrained 18-year-old relief staff person who was working a 16-hour shift and whose only previous work experience had been with the physically handicapped. All other staff of this residence had received little or no training after being hired. This was compounded by a lack of supervision of such staff and the lack of a formal supervisory on-call system for emergencies.,
Aug-81,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Frank Darby - A Resident at Craig Developmental Center,"The report recommends: that the State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities retain independent consultation to review the quality of medical care at Craig Developmental Center; that developmental center physicians seek hospital consultation promptly on behalf of seriously ill developmental center clients; that the developmental center create a mechanism to assure the transfer of patient information in a more thorough manner, to include client medical care; that mortality reviews include all staff, especially physicians, involved in a client's care and treatment; and, that the conduct of physicians who failed to provide adequate medical attention to the deceased in this case be referred to the Board of Professional Medical Conduct of the Department of Health for review.",
Jun-81,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Fred Zimmer - A Patient at Kingsboro Psychiatric Center,"Although the patient died as a direct result of being restrained following an assault upon staff of the facility, the Commission report concludes that ""there was no evidence of intent to abuse or to inflict harm upon the deceased patient.""",

The report presents the services rendered by the various care providers involved in Mr. Gordon's life and how he still fell through the cracks due to his resistiveness and the poor coordination of service, which cost more than $140,000 in Medicaid dollars alone in the last three years of his life.",
Feb-82,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Janice Sherman - A Patient at South Beach Psychiatric Center,"This is a report on the Commission and its Mental Hygiene Medical Review Board's investigation into the death of Janice Sherman [a pseudonym], a 19 year old patient at South Beach Psychiatric Center who died in restraint for agitation. She had a history of multiple psychiatric hospitalizations since the age of 15 following a suicide attempt, and unquestionably posed a severe treatment challenge to the staff of the psychiatric center. But, in attempting to cope with the patient's agitated behavior, on numerous occasions both the State Mental Hygiene Laws and the Office of Mental Health regulations governing the use of restraints and seclusion were disregarded.",

Oct-81,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Jeffrey Roland - A Patient at Rochester Psychiatric Center,"In their review, the Mental Hygiene Medical Review Board stated this unfortunate case was representative of ""a series of errors back and forth...a problem of communication."" The physicians on the Board noted that this case also raises questions about patients who decompensate frequently and postulated that, ""treating them from a base in a hospital rather than returning them to the community"" might prove to be more beneficial. This case depicts clinical chaos which culminated in a patient's falling through the cracks despite an overabundance of therapists and a variety of services.",
Dec-93,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Joan Stalker: A Study of the Need for Vigilant Monitoring of Family Care Homes,"This report chronicles the effects of the absence of proper monitoring by agencies which sponsor and certify individuals who undertake to serve mentally disabled persons. The agencies failed to detect an illegal and overcrowded family care home, as well as inappropriate discharges from state psychiatric centers to a home certified only for individuals with mental retardation, and failed to ensure the safety and well-being of residents at the home, where the deceased died under possibly abusive conditions, following earlier allegations of abuse.",
Jan-79,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Joel G. - A Resident of Rockland Psychiatric Center,"The Commission and its Mental Hygiene Medical Review Board disagreed with earlier findings by the Chief Medical Examiner of Rockland County that this death was caused by ""cardiac and respiratory arrest due to the aspiration of gastric contents."" Instead the Commission and Medical Review Board concluded that death resulted from an epileptic seizure",
Sep-79,Death Investigations,In the Matter of John D. - A Patient at Kingsboro Psychiatric Center,"The patient had been found unconscious on the grounds of Kings County Hospital, a municipal facility in Brooklyn where he was being treated at the time.",
Dec-82,Death Investigations,In the Matter of John Meginn - A Resident at Craig Developmental Center,"The Board criticized not only the surgeon for his recalcitrant attitude in accepting this case, but also the Craig Developmental Center physician, and stated that as a licensed practicing physician, he had a responsibility to assure that his patient was receiving the appropriate level of care. The Board observed that it is not accepted medical practice that permission be sought from attending physicians in order to utilize a hospital's emergency service, and he abrogated his responsibility as an advocate for the mentally disabled by knowingly allowing a lesser level of care to be afforded this client than he would have tolerated with private patients.",
Aug-80,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Joseph C. - A Resident of Craig Developmental Center,"The report recommends that the developmental center take steps to ensure coordination and communication among medical staff charged with care of clients who are seriously ill. Specifically, the report recommends: that clients deemed ill enough to be sent to an emergency room should be promptly evaluated by a facility physician upon return; and,  that facility nurses document decisions to deviate from established client treatment regimens. In addition, the report recommends that a transfer form be developed to include information, regarding the special needs of handicapped clients, for use whenever such clients are sent to other facilities or to outside practitioners, to increase communication between facility and community physicians. The report further recommends that the developmental center administration proceed, through education and direct intervention, to ensure that local general hospital physicians provide the same emergency care to developmental center clients as is afforded to the general public, and not misconstrue the developmental center's medical unit as comparable to a hospital's acute care surgical unit. Finally, the Commission report recommends that, following the unanticipated death of a client, there should be a forum for staff of all levels to exchange information, identify problem areas and plan for future intervention to prevent the recurrence of such deaths                                                       ",
Nov-82,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Leonard Gray - A Patient at Rochester Psychiatric Center,"Leonard Gray did not require psychiatric hospitalization on an acute ward of a State hospital, and he was not given proper care and attention. His "treatment plan" did not state his needs, and the use of various psychotropic medications on this patient was questionable. Mr. Gray spent the bulk of his time at RPC awaiting placement or being treated for injuries sustained there. A neurological exam apparently was not done for lack of completion of a consultation form in this neurologically-injured individual, and no assessment of whether a compression fracture and other injuries sustained at RPC had impacted on his neurological status was done. Too intelligent to be labeled retarded, and thus shunted from that service delivery system, Mr. Gray was never diagnosed as psychotic and only his depression--in reaction to his accident and his friend's and father's deaths—served as a valid reason for entry into the psychiatric center. The treatment plan lacked any strategies to deal with basic needs of this patient—toileting, ambulation training, safety, behavioral management strategies, skin care due to a brace, etc. There was never a nurse assigned to the ward on evenings or nights. This case also illustrates an apparently casual attitude toward medication administration, as well as the potential for problems with the lack of accountability of the stock drug system.",
Sep-79,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Louis F. - A Resident of Pilgrim Psychiatric Center,"Diagnostic tests upon mental patients to determine the cause of significant weight loss over a short span of time must be vigorously pursued, the Commission concluded in releasing this report on its investigation into the death of Louis F., a 77 year old patient at Pilgrim Psychiatric Center in West Brentwood, New York. Louis F. had died after suffering a dramatic weight loss over a six-week period prior to death, during which time his family was unaware of his deteriorating condition.",
Sep-81,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Mark Monroe - A Patient of St. Lawrence Psychiatric Center,"This is a report on the Commission and its Mental Hygiene Medical Review Board's investigation into the death of Mark Monroe [a pseudonym], a patient on convalescent care status at St. Lawrence Psychiatric Center, while living at an ARC community residence. The major breakdown in communication, in the absence of proper medication protocol, directly led to the death of this client.",
Dec-82,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Mia Martine - A Patient at Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center,"The case presented perplexing medical questions, as well as questions about the performance of physicians in managing and documenting the medical care of this patient. The Board also was concerned over the lack of a Mortality Review Committee assessment of the death.",
Jun-91,Quality of Care,In the Matter of Michael Goldstein: An Emergency Room Patient Discharged by Genesee Hospital,"Thirty-four-year-old Michael Goldstein (pseudonym) allegedly stabbed to death two persons in the residential hotel a few hours after discharge from Genesee Hospital's Emergency Room. During the emergency room assessment, Goldstein reported feeling suicidal and hearing voices telling him to kill people. Psychiatric social workers and an emergency room physician who interviewed Goldstein discussed their observations by telephone with the on call psychiatrist. The report calls for new policies for hospital emergency rooms requiring that an experienced psychiatrist conduct a personal examination of patients likely to cause serious harm to themselves or others. The lack of such personal evaluations by experienced psychiatrists was a common factor in tragic incidents cited by the Commission.",
Mar-82,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Molly Reed - A Client of Two Oliver Street Residence Operated by Manhattan Developmental Center,This is a report on the Commission and its Mental Hygiene Medical Review Board's investigation into the death of a 31 year old client who died after she was admitted to a hospital for treatment of severe burns sustained while at the community residence.,
Jun-83,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Patrick White - A Resident of Oswald D. Heck Developmental Center,The circumstances surrounding the death of this patient illustrate the consequences of making decisions on the medical condition of a client based primarily on the previous history without fully exploring the presenting symptomatology. The client's condition warranted more intensive medical surveillance than he received at O.D. Heck during his last four days of life.,
Dec-82,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Pedro Montez - A Patient at Manhattan Psychiatric Center,The report illustrates the inevitable and unfortunate outcome of having inadequately trained staff and trainees assigned to cope with violent patients presenting the most severe treatment problems.,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/06/nyregion/death-of-a-psychiatric-patient-is-attributed-to-undue-force.html

Oct-81,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Richard Sanders - A Resident of Newark Developmental Center,"Richard Sanders was a likable resident with a cadre of friends on the staff; his nemesis was a unilateral surgical decision and the swift processing of this decision which found him in surgery before interventions could be initiated. The changing of the preoperative diagnosis by the surgeon less than 24 hours before surgery, without notification to NDC officials, and the surgeon's previous intent to include permission for possible orchiectomy without rationale lends credence to the Commission and Mental Hygiene Medical Review Board's belief that the surgeon's actions in this case were questionable. Further, the intervention and deficient workup by the medical specialist and anesthetist exemplify the poor medical care delivered to this patient. There appeared to be a casual attitude towards unnecessary surgery among some medical practitioners at the facility.",
Jul-82,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Rita Finn - A Client of Rensselaer County Department of Mental Health Unified Services,"Inept police investigation of the unusual circumstances surrounding the 1980 death of a Rensselaer County Department of Mental Health Unified Services patient, and the ""casual attitude"" of a former Rensselaer County Medical Examiner in reviewing the death, were castigated in this Commission report.",
Apr-79,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Robert K. - A Resident of Lincoln House Operated by Westchester Developmental Center,"In light of "Robert K.'s" (a pseudonym) condition of status epilepticus and numerous seizures both before and during his residency at Lincoln House, and his propensity for wetting himself at night and attempting to toilet and cleanse himself and the potential for falling sometimes when he did, the Commission and Medical Review Board concluded, based on the facts and the extensive post mortem medical findings, that his death was natural and accidental, caused by a seizure followed by a fall, or perhaps, vice versa. The Board noted that persons who have suffered from epileptic seizures are occasionally found dead from sudden and unexplained causes. While the specific cause of death in these cases is usually not ascertainable, pathologists usually ascribe the death to the seizure disorder as a natural consequence of the disease.",
Nov-82,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Samuel Ricci - A Patient at Central Islip Psychiatric Center,"This patient was sent to CIPC's special medical/surgical unit for the express purpose of definitive diagnosis and treatment. He received neither and was medically neglected. The failure of CIPC physicians to obtain a surgical consultation, despite the need for such being noted three times in the record, appears inexcusable. No rational for treating Mr. Ricci conservatively is ever noted by physicians in the record, save for the single entry by the resident that he would be treated conservatively without any further explanation.",
Oct-83,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Simon Paz - A Patient at South Beach Psychiatric Center,"The Commission's investigation determined Mr. Paz was a difficult patient; but the Board noted such patients are not unique and manipulation, noncompliance, and lack of insight and judgment regarding their condition are not uncommon features of chronic ""revolving door"" patients. An increasing number of mentally persons, particularly younger patients, are also alcohol and drug abusers. It is clear that a better effort needs to be made to confront the admittedly difficult challenge such patients present to State psychiatric facilities.",
Aug-91,Death Investigations,In the Matter of the Jacob Home: An Uncertified Adult Home Serving Residents with Mental Illness," This report is on the investigation of an unlicensed adult home where two residents with mental illness died and residents lived under filthy and unsafe conditions, while the Department of Social Services failed repeatedly over several years to take effective enforcement action to protect residents and close the home. One resident died of hypothermia after the home lacked adequate heat and neglect by the home's operator of another resident's medical needs resulted in his death from tuberculosis. Mental health clinic case mangers responsible for residents' needs and services also did not maintain regular contact or respond to resident complaints about their treatment and obvious problems at the home.",

May-97,Policy,Incident Reporting and Management Practices at Five NYS Psychiatric Centers,"This Commission review of incident management practices at five state psychiatric centers surfaced several decidedly positive findings: episodes of patient elopements were reduced by more than 80% from 1994 to 1996. When incidents jeopardizing patient safety are identified, patients are provided prompt protective measures and/or treatment services; and incident investigations usually were timely and thorough, though some facilities need to improve in these areas and in the use and composition of Incident Review Committees (IRCs).",
Mar-91,Policy,Inmates with Developmental Disabilities in NYS Correctional Facilities,"At the time this report was published, there were over 1,000 inmates in New York State's prison system who are developmentally disabled representing, however, only about 2 percent of the approximately 53,400 inmates in custody.

Mar-87,Quality of Care,Investigation into Conditions at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center,"The report concludes that the incidents of escapes and LWOCs, complaints about patient care and patient deaths studied collectively suggest ""systemic breakdowns in the provision of appropriate care and treatment to patients, in training and supervision of staff, and in management's monitoring and oversight of the facility's performance despite repeated notification of deficiencies.""",

The report noted that two of the assailants were convicted of manslaughter in the first degree and the third of assault in the first degree following the victim's death, which was found to be caused by toxemia due to extensive peritonitis, resulting from a perforation of the small intestine.",
Dec-84,Death Investigations,In the Matter of John Dawson - An Outpatient at the Albany County Mental Health Clinic,"There is an urgent need for mental health and law enforcement agencies statewide to cooperate and develop policies, training and information-sharing procedures to enable police officers to handle crises in the community involving the mentally ill, according to this Commission report.

Jun-93,Death Investigations,Life and Death at New Queen Esther Home for Adults,"The report illustrates the consequences of inappropriately discharging a psychiatric center inpatient to an adult home ill-equipped to provide the appropriate level of supervision and services. At an adult home with inadequate mental health services, a long history of assaults and acting out behavior by residents, pleas by staff for assistance with problem residents and calls to 911, and 12 years of citations for filthy and unsafe living conditions by the Department of Social Services, a known problem resident assaulted and critically injured another woman resident.",

Mar-83,Policy,Managing Resources in the Mental Hygiene System - The Incident Reporting and Review System: More Process Than Is Due,"Calling for a major overhaul of the Incident Reporting and review System at State psychiatric and developmental centers, this Commission report indicated there are ""fundamental flaws"" in the system.

Feb-83,Quality of Care,Managing Resources in the Mental Hygiene System: The Evolution of Discrete Mental Retardation Units,"A report on the Discrete Mental Retardation Units (DMRUs), located on the grounds of State psychiatric centers and staffed by developmental centers. Though initially failures at providing appropriate care to persons inappropriately retained at psychiatric centers, over a three-year period DMRUs overcame many of the problems associated with their inauspicious beginnings. While significant progress has been noted at the six downstate locations, the Commission report chronicles three years of monitoring and recommended specific continued action to ensure a uniformly high caliber of care.",
Nov-86,Quality of Care,Medication Practices in New York State Developmental Centers: A Post-Willowbrook Report of Practices at Five Developmental Centers,"After conducting one of the largest studies of the use of psychotropic and anticonvulsant medications in State centers serving the mentally retarded and other developmentally disabled persons, the Commission published this report which cited many improvements  at the centers, while also finding significant deficiencies in monitoring of the use and side effects of such medications.",

As a result of diversion of over one-half million dollars of the revenues during a five-year period by CLA's executive director and his wife who served as president of a phantom board of directors, residents of the only group home it operated lived in poor conditions without active treatment and recreation, and the home was chronically out-of-compliance with OMRDD regulations.",

Jul-89,Policy,Outpatient Mental Health Services," Citing total expenditures of over $800 million annually supporting 950 mental health outpatient programs, this Commission report maintains that existing problems in meeting the community service needs of the State's citizens with serious mental illness have less to do with the need for more money than the need to hold existing programs more accountable for providing them with necessary outpatient mental health services. The Commission report identified numerous weaknesses in accountability for mental health outpatient program performance and their cost-effective expenditure of public funds.",
July 1988,Death Investigations,Outpatient Suicide: A Descriptive Study of 172 Outpatient Suicides Reported by New York State Mental Health Programs in 1982,"The Commission report on its study of all 172 outpatient suicides reported for the year 1982 concludes that an increasing rate of reported suicides among psychiatric outpatients in the past several years suggests a need for more extensive, appropriate and effective community services. ",
Dec-90,Policy,Oversight of Transportation Services for Persons with Mental Disabilities,"The Commission's reviews of several deaths of mentally disabled clients in motor vehicle accidents during 1989 and 1990 revealed flaws in the oversight of transportation services among State agencies responsible for ensuring client safety.

With the hope of replicating sound operating practices statewide, the Commission visited QCNI because it appeared to be one of the more efficient clinics licensed by OMH, with 1992 costs per 30-minute individual psychotherapy session at less than one-half of the statewide average, and clinician visits per day almost three times the statewide clinic average. But the Commission's review determined that this seeming efficiency concealed a clinic program rife with serious problems in the quality of its high-volume services, improper billings to Medicaid accounting for almost one-fifth of its Medicaid income, diversion of agency assets to senior executives, failure of the board of directors to exercise its fiduciary responsibilities, and unprofessional conduct by the agency's CPA who helped conceal financial irregularities from the board of directors and OMH.",

Jul-88,Death Investigations,In the Matter of Ramon Luz - A Patient at Rockland Psychiatric Center,"This case revealed a failure of psychiatric treatment and of supervision in the clinical care of a voluntary patient at a state psychiatric center who was subjected to polypharmacy despite his objections.

Jan-95,Fiscal Invesigation,Safeguarding Public Funds: A Review of Spending Practices in OMRDD Rate Appeals,"This report is on the State Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities' (OMRDD) system for processing appeals of Medicaid rates for community-based programs, which does not adequately safeguard the expenditure of public funds or control costs. The system, which is intended to ensure that Medicaid rates are sufficient to cover the costs of efficiently-run facilities, granted appeal funding of $22 million in 1991, even though in many cases the money was not spent on the purpose for which it was claimed, or not spent at all.

The critical lack of inpatient and community-based services for mentally ill persons with these multiple disabilities creates an enormous and costly gap, which results in increased psychiatric hospitalization rates and longer lengths of stay for such patients, substantially contributing to overcrowding of psychiatric admission units involuntary, municipal and State hospitals.",
