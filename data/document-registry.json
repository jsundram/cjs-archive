In addition, the report recommends that a transfer form be developed to include information, regarding the special needs of handicapped clients, for use whenever such clients are sent to other facilities or to outside practitioners, to increase communication between facility and community physicians. The report further recommends that the developmental center administration proceed, through education and direct intervention, to ensure that local general hospital physicians provide the same emergency care to developmental center clients as is afforded to the general public, and not misconstrue the developmental center's medical unit as comparable to a hospital's acute care surgical unit. Finally, the Commission report recommends that, following the unanticipated death of a client, there should be a forum for staff of all levels to exchange information, identify problem areas and plan for future intervention to prevent the recurrence of such deaths                                                       ",

With the hope of replicating sound operating practices statewide, the Commission visited QCNI because it appeared to be one of the more efficient clinics licensed by OMH, with 1992 costs per 30-minute individual psychotherapy session at less than one-half of the statewide average, and clinician visits per day almost three times the statewide clinic average. But the Commission's review determined that this seeming efficiency concealed a clinic program rife with serious problems in the quality of its high-volume services, improper billings to Medicaid accounting for almost one-fifth of its Medicaid income, diversion of agency assets to senior executives, failure of the board of directors to exercise its fiduciary responsibilities, and unprofessional conduct by the agency's CPA who helped conceal financial irregularities from the board of directors and OMH.",
