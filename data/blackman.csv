Court Monitor,,,,
"Clarence Sundram was appointed as a member of the Evaluation Team and later as the Court Monitor in a special education lawsuit in Washington DC. Blackman. v. District of Columbia is a class action originally filed in 1997 to challenge the city public school system’s failure to comply with requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), a federal law that guarantees children with disabilities the right to a free and appropriate public education. The case was consolidated with another, Jones v. District of Columbia, and a 2006 consent decree set specific goals for the city to address the needs of hundreds of students with mental or physical disabilities who were awaiting services. The city agreed to eliminate a backlog of more than 1,000 decisions by hearing officers ordering the school system to provide services to which the students are entitled under the IDEA. However, the school system has repeatedly missed deadlines to comply with the decree. In December 2007, an agreement resulting from the dispute-resolution process mandated by the decree committed the city to more than $6 million worth of programs. Included are additional mental health services, more nationally recognized models for helping students with disabilities in the classroom and more support for parents. https://www.bazelon.org/blackman-v-district-of-columbia/",,,,
