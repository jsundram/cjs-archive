Over my career, I have served on monitoring bodies in federal court class action cases involving the rights of institutionalized persons with disabilities including the Willowbrook case (NY), O'Toole v. Hochul (NY), Wyatt (AL), Forest Haven (DC), and Pineland (ME). One case involved the due process rights of students in special education (Blackman Jones [DC]). The roles have varied from Special Master (DC & ME), Court Monitor (DC) and Independent Reviewer (NY), and sometimes as a member of a multi-person panel or Committee (e.g. the seven member Willowbrook Review Panel and the five member Wyatt Consultant Committee). Some examples of this work follow.
